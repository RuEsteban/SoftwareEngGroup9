## Project Description
Our website is a peer-to-peer marketplace for businesses to exchange services to customers. Our website offers a place to build communities and relationships between customers for a variety of different services. These services include classes, repairments, selling clothes, or any services. GatorConnect allows businesses to grow their business through expansion of customers. 

## Solution for Challenge Statement
Our solution to the challenge statement is a website that connects local businesses and consumers through the ability to post and browse business listings. These listings can be for any number of activities, such as cooking classes, gardening services, dance lessons, or sports coaching. By signing up with an email or through their Google account, customers can message and pay for these services through our site. Users have the ability to change their passwords as well as create, edit, or delete their own posts. Posts can display a company name and contact information, price range, description, rating, and location.
